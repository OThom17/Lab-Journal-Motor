# Development of Motor Design

## Potential Developments

As mentioned in the electromagnetics lecture there are a number of design considerations which will improve the motor. 

- Number of copper coils

The point at which the coils are aligned with the magnetic field (Angle = 0) can be considered as a 'dead' region. The inertia from the electromotive force drives the armature into a postion which is again at a normal to the magentic field thus inducing the force once more. By increasing the number of coils the size of the 'dead' region becomes reduced and the motor runs smoother and more efficiently. 

- Number of poles

Similarly by increasing the number of poles would reduce the period with no forces being induced.

- Commutator Design

Typically brushes are used to ensure a reliable connection between the supply and armature. An improvement upon this may be to use a sprung conductor such as a wire. This would limit energy waste through sparking and ensure a more consistent connection.


- Inclusion of an iron based core

Having an iron core within a magnetic field increases the 'u' value which increases the flux density. This in turn increases the electromotive force experienced by the current carrying wire.


- Frictional losses at the rotation points

By adding low friction surfaces at either end the armature the mechnical losses through heat and sound will be minimised. Furthermore by constructing the armature from lightweight materials less force will be required to perform a rotation.

- More evenly distributed magnetic field

In the first example the magnets were placed in a single stack either side of the armature. To more evenly distribute these would generate a more homogeneous field increasing the efficiency and force induced in the armature.
