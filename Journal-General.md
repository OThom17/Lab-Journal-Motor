# Building the basic design

## Communator

The commutator is a component responsible for changing the polarisation of the magnetic field thus a force rotating the shaft.

Adhesive copper stripping has been added to either side of the cork. The two pieces will allow for a seperate electrical polarity to be applied thus switching the magnetic field polarity.

The pins will act as an axel allowing for free rotation.

The copper wire has been wrapped around the shaft and connected to the commutator through a solder joint. The ends of the copper wire have been stripped of their plastic covering to allow for a good connection.

Two copper contacts have been placed either side of the commutator. These in standard rotors are termed the 'brushes' and are used to connect the supply to both of the commutators alternatively.
